Although I am an electrical engineering student, I’ve grown to love software and spend a big chunk of my free time programming.  My experience developing embedded projects for a physics lab at school has given me experience in Python, C, SQL and other web related languages that would be a great fit for working with \field. I absolutely love learning new things and would not be afraid to dive in and work hard. 

My favourite project I’ve worked on was an indoor weather station/web server I built while volunteering as a research assistant at an optics lab at school. The project, written mainly in Python, involved gathering and storing ambient sensor data using a Raspberry Pi linux-based microcontroller. Additionally I have GUI experience as I learned enough HTML/Javascript/SQL to create a small website enabling anyone in the lab to view the short term and long term graphs of the ambient data.

I love all technology and am able to adapt to just about any development environment. I use Linux with Bash for most stuff but own and use machines with all three major OSs. Furthermore I’ve used a whole bunch of different IDEs and have experience working on software with a team and managing version control using Github.

Thank you for taking the time to read my application, I look forward to hearing from you in the future. To arrange an interview, please contact the Co-op Office at 604.822.6995 or coop.interviews@ubc.ca.
